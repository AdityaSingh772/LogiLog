# Startup Project

This repository contains the codebase for a microservices-based startup project. It includes four microservices and a GraphQL gateway. Each service interacts with its own PostgreSQL database.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Account Service** (`account/`): Handles user authentication and account management.
2. **Shopify Service** (`shopify/`): Integrates with the Shopify API for order management.
3. **Shipment Service** (`shipment/`): Manages shipment processing and courier integrations.
4. **Payment Service** (`payment/`): Handles payment processing and wallet management.
5. **GraphQL Gateway** (`graphql/`): Acts as a single access point for querying and managing data from the microservices.

Each service is containerized and uses **PostgreSQL** as its database.

---

## Requirements

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/) (for backend services)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the GraphQL gateway)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Instructions

### Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
    Create `.env` files in the root directories of each microservice (`account`, `shopify`, `shipment`, `payment`, `graphql`). Refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.

3. **Start PostgreSQL Containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
    ```

4. **Run Each Service**:
    - For Go-based services:
      ```bash
      cd <service-folder>
      go run main.go
      ```
    - For the GraphQL gateway:
      ```bash
      cd graphql
      npm install
      npm run dev
      ```

---

### Staging Environment

1. **Environment Variables**:
    Use `.env.staging` files for staging credentials in each service.

2. **Start PostgreSQL Containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
    ```

3. **Run Services in Staging Mode**:
    - For Go-based services:
      ```bash
      ENV=staging go run main.go
      ```
    - For the GraphQL gateway:
      ```bash
      npm run start-staging
      ```

---

## Environment Variables

Each service requires specific environment variables. Here are examples:

### Account Service (`account/.env`):
```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=account_db
DB_USER=dev_user
DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
```

### Shopify Service (`shopify/.env`):
```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=shopify_db
DB_USER=dev_user
DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
```

### Shipment Service (`shipment/.env`):
```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=shipment_db
DB_USER=dev_user
DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
```

### Payment Service (`payment/.env`):
```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=payment_db
DB_USER=dev_user
DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
```

### GraphQL Gateway (`graphql/.env`):
```plaintext
GRAPHQL_PORT=4000
ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
SHOPIFY_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3002
SHIPMENT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3003
PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3004
```

## Running the Application

1. **Start PostgreSQL Containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Run Each Service**:
    Follow the steps in [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions).

3. **Access the Services**:
    - Account: `http://localhost:3001`
    - Shopify: `http://localhost:3002`
    - Shipment: `http://localhost:3003`
    - Payment: `http://localhost:3004`
    - GraphQL Gateway: `http://localhost:4000`

## GraphQL Interaction

The GraphQL gateway serves as a single access point for interacting with all microservices.

### Example Query:
Fetch orders:
```graphql
query GetOrders {
  orders {
    id
    status
    totalPrice
  }
}
```

### Example Mutation:
Create an order:
```graphql
mutation CreateOrder($input: OrderInput!) {
  createOrder(input: $input) {
    id
    status
    totalPrice
  }
}
```

GraphQL resolves these queries and mutations by interacting with the appropriate microservices.

---

## Database Management

- Development: `postgres://dev_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/{service_db}`
- Staging: `postgres://staging_user:staging_password@staging_host:5432/{service_db}`

Use tools like [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or `psql` for database operations.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Issues**:
    - Verify PostgreSQL is running.
    - Check `.env` or `.env.staging` files for correct credentials.

2. **Service Connectivity**:
    - Ensure the services are accessible at their specified ports.

3. **GraphQL Gateway Errors**:
    - Check microservices' URLs in `graphql/.env`.
